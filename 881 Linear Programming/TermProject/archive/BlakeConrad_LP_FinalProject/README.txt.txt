Simply double click and your default browser should show you the results.

--- Reproducin Results -----
----------------------------

You first must install each package for the specified python environment this code was run on. This can be done several ways, the quickest by far is below:

***************************************
* * pip install -r requirements.txt * *
***************************************
The above command installs all of the packages in requirements.txt into your python environment so you can run the code.

***********************
* * python final.py * *
***********************

You can also view the code in the Jupyter notebook where I ran all of my experiments.

************************************
* * jupyter notebook final.ipynb * *
